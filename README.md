`makerflow events list` will list recently ended, ongoing and upcoming events from Google Calendar.

## Upcoming

Makerflow VScode plugin is coming soon to trigger "Flow Mode" automatically, so you can get more done

A Chrome/Firefox extension is also in the works to automatically block distracting websites when you
are in Flow Mode.
