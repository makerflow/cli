# Makerflow

Makerflow is a deep work  and collaboration assistant for developers. Get in the zone without 
hiding away from your product manager, designer or other teammates!

### Pre-requisites

You will need a free Makerflow account and API token to get started. Sign up or login at https://makerflow.co

You can get a new token from https://app.makerflow.co/settings#api

### Installation

Install the package globally using `npm install -g makerflow`

Once installed, run `makerflow config token` to set your API token.

### Usage

Get a list of available commands with `makerflow help`

#### Flow Mode

Flow Mode turns on "do-not-disturb" mode on macOS to block your notifications and 
prevent distractions. If you have your Slack workspace connected to Makerflow, turning on 
"Flow Mode" will automatically set your Slack status to let your teammates know you might be
slow to respond

To start Flow Mode, run `makerflow start` and to end it, run `makerflow stop`

## Pro-tip

Get the Makerflow VScode plugin to trigger "Flow Mode" automatically.
Also, get the Chrome/Firefox extension to automatically block distracting websites when you 
are in flow state.
